Extra credit controls:

Move origin: Arrow Keys (5 pixel increments)

Increase/decrease divisions: comma (decrease) period (increase) 

Increase/decrease grid size: left bracket (decrease) right bracket (increase)

(1, 2, and 3 all work as described in the lab doc)


There is also a persistent bug where extra lines will be drawn outside the borders
of the grid, but no amount of changes to the code or numbers used to calculate
line renders have been able to fix it. The grid itself and all required features
function perfectly, though. This was a fun lab! I look forward to next week.
